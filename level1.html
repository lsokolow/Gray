    <h4> As a teen in high school its hard to juggle school, sports and extracuriculars, especially with villains running around causing trouble.
    You are out walking when you see a burning building with people trapped inside. Near the building is a bank and you notice everyone is walking out and are distracted by the commotion.</h4>
    <h5>Are you going to save the people trapped? Take advantage of the distraction and rob the bank? or simply walk away?</h5>
