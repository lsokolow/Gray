    <h4>
      You're at the bus stop coming home from a game at 7pm. All the sudden a figure appears and collaspes on the seat out of breath and limping. You recognize them as the villain NightCry who mostly trgets any place with money. You see how hurt the villain is and hear heroes and the police persuing them.
    <p>
      Will you help the villain escape? Help the police catch them? or simply do nothing?
